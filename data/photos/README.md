abstract = { To ensure that users of online services understand what data are collected and how they are used in algorithmic decision-making, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) specifies informed consent as a minimal requirement. For online news outlets consent is commonly elicited through interface design elements in the form of a pop-up. We have manually analyzed 300 data collection consent notices from news outlets that are built to ensure compliance with GDPR. The analysis uncovered a variety of strategies or dark patterns that circumvent the intent of GDPR by design. We further study the presence and variety of these dark patterns in these “cookie consents” and use our observations to specify the concept of dark pattern in the context of consent elicitation.},
